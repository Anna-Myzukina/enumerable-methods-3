# Project 2: Enumerable Methods in Ruby

## PROJECT: ADVANCED BUILDING BLOCKS (Project 2: Enumerable Methods)

This is the second project of the main `Ruby` curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc

### [Assignment link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/advanced-building-blocks)

#### The objective is to add new methods onto the existing Ruby Enumerable module. Such methods are as follows

1. Create `#my_each`, a method that is identical to #each
2. Create `#my_each_with_index` in the same way.
3. Create `#my_select` in the same way, though you may use #my_each in your definition (but not #each).
4. Create `#my_all?` (continue as above)
5. Create `#my_any?`
6. Create `#my_none?`
7. Create `#my_count`
8. Create `#my_map`
9. Create `#my_inject`
10. Test your `#my_inject` by creating a method called `#multiply_els` which multiplies all the elements of the array together by using `#my_inject`, e.g. `multiply_els([2,4,5]) #=> 40`
